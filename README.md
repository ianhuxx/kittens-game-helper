# 🐱 Kittens Game Helper

One-click **autopilot** for [Kittens Game](https://kittensgame.com/web/) that runs in
your browser, **continues the save you already have**, and shows you what to build or
research next.

It is a thin wrapper around [**Kitten Scientists**](https://github.com/kitten-science/kitten-scientists)
(KS) — the proven, open-source automation engine for this game. This project doesn't
re-invent the automation; it loads KS, turns on every **safe** automation for you, and
keeps the dangerous stuff (prestige **resets**) off so your progress is never wiped.

> **Why not machine learning?** Kittens Game is deterministic and already "solved" by
> well-known heuristics. There is no published ML/RL bot for it, and rule-based tools
> like KS beat ML here. ML would be slower, harder, and worse — so this uses the proven
> rule-based engine instead.

## Quick start (about 2 minutes)

1. **Back up your save first.** In the game: **Options → Export**, and copy the text
   somewhere safe. (Automation changes your real save; this is your undo.)
2. Install a userscript manager: **[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)**
   (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari).
3. Install this script: open
   [`src/kittens-game-helper.user.js`](src/kittens-game-helper.user.js) → click **Raw**
   → Tampermonkey offers to install it → **Install**.
   (Or open Tampermonkey → *Create a new script*, paste the file contents, save.)
4. Open / refresh **<https://kittensgame.com/web/>**.
5. A 🐱 **Kittens Helper** box appears bottom-right. It already started on
   **Autopilot**. To switch modes, pick one and click **Apply**.

That's it — it plays in the same browser tab where your save lives. There is no account
to log into; the game is stored locally in your browser.

## The two modes

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Autopilot: play forward** *(default)* | Turns **on every safe automation**: job assignment, building, research, crafting, trade, faith, space, hunting, festivals, and time acceleration. It also **auto-tunes every build threshold** so it buys the moment something is affordable — you never touch a number. It plays the game for you. |
| **Assist: jobs + advice** | Only assigns jobs, hunts, holds festivals and watches for star events. **You** decide what to build/research — the advisor line tells you what's next. |

**Both modes keep prestige resets OFF**, plus other irreversible/resource-burning
actions (transcend, sacrifice unicorns/alicorns, time-skip, shatter time crystals).
So it always *continues* your existing game — it will never reset it behind your back.

## The "what next" advisor

The bottom-right box shows two live lines:

- **NOW:** something you can afford right now (Autopilot buys these for you).
- **NEXT:** the closest thing you can't afford yet, and exactly how much you're missing,
  e.g. `NEXT: research Construction — need 1.20K science, 300 minerals`.

## If nothing seems to move

- Check the **KS engine:** line in the box — it should say **running ✓**. If it says
  *stopped*, click **Apply**.
- Autopilot auto-sets every build/research/craft **trigger to "as soon as affordable"**,
  so you never have to tune thresholds. Click **Apply** to re-apply.
- Early game is resource-limited: read the **NEXT:** line — it's waiting on the listed
  resource. Hunting/crafting will catch up.

## Turning on resets later (advanced, optional)

Resets trade your current run for permanent bonuses (Paragon/Karma). This **wipes the
current game**, so it's intentionally not automated here. If you want it after you've
**exported a backup**, enable it yourself in **KS → Time Control → Reset** and configure
the thresholds.
